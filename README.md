# SQL-50

## About LeetCode SQL-50
This repository contains my solutions to the LeetCode SQL-50 study plan. The purpose of this project is to practice and strengthen my SQL skills, a foundational language for anyone working with data.

As an aspiring data professional, whether in data engineering, data science, machine learning, or data analysis, I believe that a deep understanding of SQL is essential. This repository serves as a personal log of my progress through the LeetCode SQL 50 problems. By solving these problems, I aim to:
* Reinforce core SQL concepts like JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, window functions, and subqueries.
* Improve problem-solving skills by translating real-world data scenarios into efficient SQL queries.
* Prepare for technical interviews by tackling common SQL patterns and challenges.
